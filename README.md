# LoginPageV1.0

**[High School ICT / VCL application]** Yeah, Ik it’s a shitcode, but I tried at least to learn Object Pascal and practice with Delphi’s Visual Component Library.

## Major version v1.0

- Just a login prototype example with a constant login and password set in the code itself.
- Horsesh#t security, to be honest. (Don’t blame me; it was just a high school project.)
- Just a MemoBox for messaging the user that the process of login has been successful.
